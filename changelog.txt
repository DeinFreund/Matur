-paused development on file browser
+implemented radar module with placeholder texture and manual sensitivity
+client can set exposure time in 0.2 second steps
+radar module data: <sensitivityThreshold>
-radar module's performance should be tested and improved
+fixed a bug in the player class which enables one player to control every ship
+Windows can now be unloaded/removed
-onClientDisconnect needed, disconnect causes many errors

+finished blueprintManager
+added hotkey helper
-file browser under development

+added Blueprint manager(yet untested)
+added cannon/instantiator(yet untested)
-detected a bug causing the exposure shader to overwrite antialiasing

 - 18 Feb 2014
+added recursive module (Extender)

 - 9 Feb 2014
+removed old dependencies to load parts(i.e engine) on clientside and replaced by ShipClient
+fixed Window class and engine gui and added guiskin
+fixed particle system and light for engine
+added shader to simulate camera sensitivity(exposure) and added script to do auto exposure
+added antialiasing and bloom shaders by TheBlur(FuzzyQuills) and Tryder (see: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/198568-Epic-Radial-Blur-Effect-for-Unity-Indie)
